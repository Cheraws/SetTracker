# SetTracker

## Purpose
To allow one to record the exercises they do every day with the rep count and the weight.

## Guide
- Create a new Set and name it.
- Pick the exercises you want in the set from the premade list, setting the reps and the weight associated with each one.
- When you are ready to start, start the set, checking each exercise when you have finished it.
- When you are done, press Done, and you will be redirected to the page of all the sets, showing a checkmark.

## To Do
- Fitbit integration to show the heartrate for each set.
- Adding more exercises to the list.
